A collection of experimental, conceptual, and possibly silly features which improve and enhance the functionality of the LifterLMS core.

== Description ==

LifterLMS Labs is a collection of experimental, conceptual, and possibly silly features which improve and enhance the functionality of the LifterLMS core.

We've created this free LifterLMS add-on in order to provide these optional features to the LifterLMS community which may or may not be useful to everyone.

Some labs will ultimately find their way into the LifterLMS Core, some may be a lab forever.


### Current Labs


**Divi Friends**

This lab allow LifterLMS and Divi to be best friends. Currently this lab will fix layout issues visible on the LifterLMS Catalogs.

**Simple Branding**

If you don't like the default LifterLMS colors, you don't want to change themes, and you don't want to write a bit of custom CSS you can enable this lab, select a few colors, and be on your way.
